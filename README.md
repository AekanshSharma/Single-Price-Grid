## My process

### Built with
- Systematic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom Properties
- Bootstrap v5.0
- Bootstrap Grid System
- Firefox browser
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn more about basic CSS & style properties such as - padding, margin and certain others.
It also help me in increasing my understanding about bootstrap's grid system and predefined classes.
This project made use different elements of bootstrap, CSS and HTML with each other. For example:
For the bottom right part I had used card, col, and row classes of Bootstrap with table element of the HTML.

### Continued development

I still have some flows when it comes to the non repetition of the code and still lack full understanding about Bootstrap classes.
These are the areas that I still have left some room for improvements.

### Useful resources

- [Adobe Colors] [https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel] - Its helped me in knowing the color scheme of the project more easily.
- [MDN documentation] [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/]  - MDN always help in making me understand certain properties and elements that I'm not fully comfortable with yet.
